  ## Usage: 
  This app is used to generate a roster of employees. The employees fill out their information based on their position and this is taken into the system and converted into an HTML document that displays their input. In the end, you are left with a roster of employees with their name, email, and id along with other more specific info based on their position (manager, intern, or engineer). For me, the hardest part of this assignment was the final step, completing the code in "app.js". Filling out the classes were easy.

  ## Testing:
  To test this application, you can open the code in terminal, type "npm run test", and see that all of the tests pass. I had to work pretty hard at this with my tutor at first, but once we completed the first class the rest were super easy. 

  ## Installation:
  You do not need to install anything for this app. All of the code is written for the user and requires no installation (unless you count JEST and inquirer)

  ## Issues:
  You can report issues by contacting me personally at my email
